## Pandas in 10
- pandas is a python library for data, Kinda like an python excel spreadsheet
- pandas structure is a data frame
- DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data
- To load the pandas package and start working with it, import the package. 
- The community agreed alias for pandas is pd, so loading pandas as pd is assumed standard practice for all of the pandas documentation.
