## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
- Encryption is the process of encoding the data, this conversion is done with a key called an an encryption key
- Decryption is a process of decoding the encoded data. converting the ciphertext into plain text, this process requires a key that we used for encryption
- two keys used are Symmetric key, Asymmetric Key
- Symmetric key data is endcoded and decoded with the same key, this is the easiest way of encryption, but less secure
- Asymmetric Key we use two keys a public and private the public is used to encrypt the data and the private is used to decrypt the data
