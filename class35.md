## Graphs
- A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

- Graphs are commonly represented in two ways:
    - Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List
    - Adjaceny Matrix a 2D array of V x V vertices, Each row and column represent a vertex.
    - Adjacency List represents a graph as an array of linked lists
    - Adjaceny list are typically used for storage since we only need the values
    -   

## Graph Operations

1. Check if the element is present in the graph
2. Graph Traversal
3. Add elements(vertex, edges) to graph
4. Finding the path from one vertex to another
