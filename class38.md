# React 

## Conditional Rendering 
- Delivering elements based on the certain conditions 
- you can use an if else statement or the render method

## List and Keys 
- Keys are used to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted
- Lists are a list of items 
## Forms 
- form data is handled by the DOM
- forms are handled by the components 
## Lifting State
-  sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it
- It helps you avoid more complex patterns for managing your state.

## Composition vs Inheritance
- inheritance derives one class from another, composition defines a class as the sum of its parts
