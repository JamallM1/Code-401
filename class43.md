## Ethics in the Workplace
GOOGLE and AI
- I'm interested in AI, I applied to a few AI and machine learning positions. I think using AI for non violent things is a step in the right direction. As a user of google it makes me feel like my information is protected since they won't be using it for surveliance as well. I know that AI is the future and google deciding to use it for good is great. I'm just not sure how it'll be socially beneficial. 

## Ethics in Tech
Self driving cars
- I think that self driving cars are a wonderful thing. But where do you draw the line? I seen an article where a drier of a Tesla fell asleep behind the wheel when he was being pulled over by the cops. I think that maybe self driving cars should have their own lanes potentially.Who life will the self driving car prioritize if a wreck may happen, I know we have. lot of work to do with self driving cars.
